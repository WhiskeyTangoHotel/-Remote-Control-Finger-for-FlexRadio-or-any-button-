Ever need to have physical access to a button or switch at your house when you are 
nowhere near your house?  This doesn't happen often with the FlexRadio, but 
sometimes you really really really need to cycle the power or even more 
importantly "Press and Hold" the power button for a "WHITE LED REBOOT".  
A key feature of the FlexRadio is it's built in remote capability that allows 
a ham radio operator the easy use the rig from anywhere in the world.  
That, of course, is unless if you are on the opposite side of the planet and 
need access to the rigs front panel power button.
